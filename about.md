<br/>
Interested in applying my multi-domain background to identify and provide solutions to computational problems in bioinformatics. 
In particular the usage of cloud technologies for the execution of workflows. 

I have a MSc in Bioinformatics from the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona, where my thesis focused on using GPU enabled Singularity
containers in the Nextflow workflow language. I also have a BSc in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC). 

I currently work at the SIB Swiss Institue of Bioinformatics as part of the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN). In this role
I lead a 5 person working group responsible for developing tools for interoperable workflow execution.
